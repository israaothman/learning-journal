# Java Script & JQuery 

## First What is a script ?
it is a series of instructions (steps) that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
and these instructions must let the compputer solve the task programmaticlly 

### Expressions :
There is two types of expressions :
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
for example : 
var name ='Israa';

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE 
for example :
var summation = 2+3 ;
vav mul = 5*8*3 ;

### Operators :
 ther is types for the operators too :
 - ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
Assign a value to a variable 
example :
a = b ;
age = 23 ;

- COMPARISON OPERATORS
Compare two values and return true  
example :
result = 10>3 ; 
the result value will be true or false

- LOGICAL OPERATORS
Combine expressions and return true or false
example : 
pass = (50 > 0) && (100 > 50);

- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Perform basic math
example :
number = 5+9;

- STRING OPERATORS
Combine two strings 

full name = 'israa' + 'othman';


### Function :
  what is the function and how to declare one ?
  **Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function**

to declare function :
fisrt you have to write the function keyword then the function name with() then open {} and write the code inside it 
example : 
function summation() {
    var a =5;
    var b = 8;
    var c = a+b ;
}
