        <h2>What shoud we do befor we start programming or writng our code ?</h2>
        <p>
            Befor we start programming we have to know the requerment for the projet <br>
            so we have to talk to the client and understand his needs exactly and we must know who are the targert audience for this project <br>
            these thing shoud help us to build the right project <br>
             <br>
             Second thing <br>
             its very helpfull to drew a wireframes for the pages you want to design it will organize the information so you won't get confused while you are working <br>
             and to organize more you shoud drow a site maps <br>
             This picture is an example for a site map <br>
             <img src="site-map.png" alt="site map"> 
        </p>
        <p>
            After you do the previos things and start coding dont forget to differentiate between pieces of information
            using size, color, and style. <br>
            The design and the style for your pages is very important to be perfect
