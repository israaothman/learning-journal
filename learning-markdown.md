## First of all WHAT is Markdown ?
#### It is a way to style the text that you will put on your web pages 
##### This is some of these styles : 
- formatting words (bold / italic)
- adding images or imoji 
- creating list

## you can also create tables using markdown by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens and separating each column with a pipe 
### for example :

Full Name  | Major | number  
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Israa Othman | Software Engineer | 01234
Nour Ahmed | Computer sience | 01235

## There is a way to add a photo too :
##### formating : 

![ here you put the picture name ] (here you put the URL )

#### example :
![pagera] (https://d17fnq9dkz9hgj.cloudfront.net/breed-uploads/2018/08/American-Bobtail_Black-1.jpg?bust=1538149164)
