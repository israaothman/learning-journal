# Operators and Loops

### Comparison and logical operators 
 * you can use the comparison to evaluate a situation by comapring a value what you expect it might be 
 and the result will be true or false only  / 
 for example : / 
 var name = 'israa';
 var cheeck = (name == 'israa');

 **the cheeck value will be true**

- operators :
 + == it means **is equal to**
 + =! it means **is not equal to**
 + === it means **stict equal to _(same vale same dataType)_**
 + !== it means **strict not equal to**
 + + ' > **greater than** '
 + < **less than** 
 + ' >= **greater than or equal** '
 + <= **less than or equal** 

 - logical operators :
  + && **and**
  + '||' **or**
  + ! **not**
